# Nitro

Three.js game

## Getting started

To get started with the project, run the following commands:

1. Clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/refiloemopeloa/Nitro
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```shell
cd Nitro
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

## Available scripts

In this project directory, you can run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will run the app with `Vite` in develop mode. 
Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Alternatively, you can run:

```shell
npx vite
```
## Push to lamp server

When you push anything to main, it will automatically push to the lamp server.

This will do the same thing as the run script above.
